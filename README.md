Magic 8 Ball
============
In this project we will recreate the [magic 8 ball toy](https://www.magic8ball.org/inside-the-magic-8-ball/) using turtle graphics in Python.
 
For full credit, your finished program should
+ Provide an answer based on user input (e.g. clicking the mouse or typing on the keyboard)
+ Store the answers in a list
+ Use `random()` to choose one answer randomly from the list and display it
 
Have fun and be creative. Your magic 8 ball app doesn't have to work or look like anyone else's. (Students in the past have used different artwork to create apps like "Ask Al Gore" or "Ask Bootsy Collins.") 
 
The original Magic 8 Ball toy had 20 answers. You can use these answers or create your own:
+ It is certain
+ It is decidedly so
+ Without a doubt
+ Yes definitely
+ You may rely on it
+ As I see it, yes
+ Most likely
+ Outlook good
+ Yes
+ Signs point to yes
+ Reply hazy try again
+ Ask again later
+ Better not tell you now
+ Cannot predict now
+ Concentrate and ask again
+ Don't count on it
+ My reply is no
+ My sources say no
+ Outlook not so good
+ Very doubtful
